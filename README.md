#Lesson Learned
Art of doing nothing: Its got to the point that when I'm not working on code that it's all I think about. I will be having converstaions with people, playing video games, playing on my phone, or sleeping and all I can think about is that one Bug I haven't solved. On the rare moments I'm not thinking about my code and I can relax and do nothing I can still feel the code tickling at the back of my mind trying to dig itself back in. Well I fianlly realized that that wasn't my code, but my epiphany wait for me to pay attention to it. There was trying to mind my on buisness when I had my first Ah ha moment. I had bug with trying to update my images and I had stared at the code for a few hours not seeing what was right in front of me. I walked away, a few hours later after doing absolutely nothing I had an epiphany. It hit me so hard I swear I almost fell over. There it was I never updated the images into my Impl, so they were never going to update.
